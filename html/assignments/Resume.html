                Detecting the Objects in Real Time Visual Media Using Deep Learning Techniques
            </b>
            <br>
            Object detection and Object Recognition are the most important things that play an important role in 
            the development and enhancement of computer vision systems. This project aims to overcome it by 
            using the Deep Learning-based approach, convolutional (CNN) with the model You Only Look Once 
            (YOLO) approach with Open CV. The major challenge in many of the object detection algorithms used 
            for computer vision systems is slow.

            <b>
                Detecting the Objects in Real Time Visual Media Using Deep Learning Techniques
            </b>
            <br>
            Vision Based Detection Using Image Processing Techniques for Beverage Industry
            In the beverage industry, ensuring the quality of cool drink bottles traditionally involves a combination 
            of sensors and manual inspections. To address this challenge, We Implement a “Camera-Based 
            System” to replace traditional sensors with “Deep Learning Technology” called Single Shot Detector 
            (SSD) in quality control for cool drink bottles can offer several advantages
